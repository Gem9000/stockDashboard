# stockDashboard

The following dashboard will use flask and the BLANK REST API to display several key indecies and stocks. I wanted to do this project because I was annoyed by having to search market information individualy anytime I wanted to check something. 

The following packages will be used and the project will be written mostly in Python, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Please see the table below for the package name and version.
